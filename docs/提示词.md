Design a Flutter mobile application focused on anime and series tracking, with a strong emphasis on artistic aesthetics, clear functional separation, and smooth user experience.

Overall Visual Style
	•	The application should have a relaxed, artistic, and modern style.
	•	Use a soft, natural color palette, such as warm off-white, beige, light gray, and muted pastel accents.
	•	Avoid high-contrast or overly saturated colors; the tone should feel calm, cozy, and suitable for daily use.
	•	Typography should emphasize artistic or serif-inspired fonts for titles, paired with clean, readable fonts for body text.
	•	Layout should feel magazine-like, with generous spacing, balanced composition, and subtle depth.
	•	All transitions and interactions should feel fluid and organic, using smooth animations and gentle easing rather than abrupt changes.

Application Structure and Modules
	1.	Home / Anime Library
	•	Acts as the main discovery hub.
	•	Displays a comprehensive list of anime, including cover images, titles, platforms, and latest episode updates.
	•	Highlights currently updating or trending anime.
	•	Supports searching and browsing, with visually rich anime cards.
	•	Serves as the primary entry point to anime detail pages.
	2.	Weekly Schedule
	•	Organizes anime updates by Monday through Sunday.
	•	Allows users to clearly see what anime updates on each day.
	•	Supports user-defined tracking, where users can manually record or adjust which anime updates on a given day.
	•	Enables simple progress tracking, such as the latest watched episode.
	•	Focuses on clarity, order, and daily rhythm rather than dense information.
	3.	Anime Detail & Insights
	•	Provides detailed information for a specific anime.
	•	Includes cover art, basic description, update status, and streaming platforms.
	•	Contains an “Anime Insights” section showing:
	•	Original source material (e.g., manga, novel, original work).
	•	AI-generated summaries and contextual explanations.
	•	Additional background or world-building information.
	•	Designed to feel informative yet calm, similar to reading a curated encyclopedia entry.
	4.	AI Assistant
	•	Implemented as a dedicated, independent page.
	•	Focuses on AI-assisted content such as:
	•	Anime summaries
	•	Latest news and related information
	•	General anime-related questions
	•	Responses should appear in a streaming, progressive manner, creating a sense of live generation.
	•	Each time the page opens, it should present suggested questions based on current popular anime topics, which users can tap to ask instantly.
	•	The interaction style should feel conversational, intelligent, and unobtrusive.
	5.	Favorites & Collection
	•	Allows users to collect and manage their favorite anime.
	•	Supports custom ordering and simple categorization.
	•	Designed to feel personal and curated, like a private bookshelf or collection.
	6.	Profile / Personal Page
	•	Displays basic user information and preferences.
	•	Acts as the central place for managing personal data and app-level settings.
	•	Maintains a minimal and calm design, avoiding visual clutter.

Interaction and Experience Principles
	•	Every module should have a clear responsibility and avoid overlapping functionality.
	•	Navigation between sections should be intuitive and predictable.
	•	Visual hierarchy should guide users naturally, without requiring explanation.
	•	Animations should enhance understanding and atmosphere, never distract from content.
	•	The overall experience should feel gentle, creative, and immersive, suitable for long-term daily use.
